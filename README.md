**I'm trying to bring the mechanics from Free League's Ruins of Symbaroum into version 13 as they have indicated that they will no longer be supporting their Foundry implementation as of the beginning of Version 12**

characters use an alternate spellcasting system from core dnd5e focused on a secondary attribute pool called "Corruption". 
This field is displayed on 5e actor sheets currently using the custom fields module.

Corruption starts at 0 and increases from there. Most Corruption gathered is temporary, your character struggles against a dark foe, or uses non-permanent magic and their Shadow temporarily grows darker. However, sometimes you will gain permanent Corruption, usually by taking up a powerful magical item or by exceeding your Corruption Threshold.

For non-Mystic characters, your Corruption Threshold is equal to the total of twice your proficiency bonus plus your Charisma modifier, as the influence of a darkening Shadow makes most people gloomy and morose. So the formula is:

Corruption Threshold = (your level + your Charisma modifier), minimum 2.

During the course of the game, you will gain temporary Corruption. You might also start with a certain amount of permanent Corruption, due to your equipment or mishaps in the past. Your starting Corruption value can never be lower than your permanent Corruption score.

If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, you must make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the Marks of Corruption table to the right. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.


the module will automatically manage the increase in Temporary or Permanent Corruption generated from casting spells. 
When a spell item is called, 1d4 + spell level is applied to an actor's Temporary Corruption.

If your total Corruption (temporary plus permanent) exceeds your Corruption Threshold, the module will make a Corruption check, to see if you can bear so much darkness. Roll a d20. If the result is equal to or less than the amount by which your current Corruption exceeds your Threshold, you will gain a mark of Corruption. Roll 1d20 on the Marks of Corruption table. The mark fades 24 hours after your total Corruption drops below your Corruption Threshold.
